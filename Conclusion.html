	<h1> Welcome!</h1>
	<p> Thank you for reading my self-published webpage on how I created my first Webpage.
	 Of course there is work to do, since I did not attend professional courses. But, this <b><i><u style="cursor: wait">isn't bad</u></i></b> quality, if you ask me.
<br>
<p>Awesomeness and inteligence lies to the person(s) that was the deperation and the charasteristics to trive for more and more knowledge. But, it's not as easy as it might sound. Exactly how many times have you done your work first, <i>before</i> checking out your social media. </p>
